You can run my program by 
python dir-server.py <dsport>
python app-server.py <dsport>
python app-client.py <dsport> <dbport> 

Note: during my screenshot, I was not able to ssh to any lind hall computers so instead I ssh into kh1200 for the app-client

The files names that are used for each size are hard-coded into my program so you would need to have file names: 
1. 10KB
2. 100KB
3. 1000KB
4. 10000KB
These are also hard coded that these files are in the current directory of the app-client.py

The screenshots are all in one .png file for all the app-server, app-client, and dir-server messages.
